# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is one of my first projects where I created a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The user plays against a NPC (Non-Player Character). The goal of the game is to make the right choice and beat the NPC.

## Features
- The user can choose between the options Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- The NPC randomly selects an option as well.
- The game compares the user's choice with the NPC's choice and determines the winner based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- A scoring system is used to track the user's score. The score increases when the user wins and decreases when the user loses.

## Learning Objectives
In this project, I learned the following concepts:
- Working with conditions in programming languages.
- Implementing a simple algorithm for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
- Creating a scoring system based on conditions.

## Instructions
1. Start the game and choose an option (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
2. The NPC also chooses an option.
3. The game determines the winner based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
4. Your score will be updated accordingly.

Enjoy playing!
